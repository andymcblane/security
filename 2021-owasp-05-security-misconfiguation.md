# Security Misconfiguration
_If you had a public S3 bucket, would you know about it?_

There is *a lot* of low hanging fruit in this category. Unfortuantely for us, one misconfiguration can result in a successful attack.

e.g how can the infrastructure engineer be expected to understand the full helm chart for a multi-pod application, including hidden defaults? What impact does this have on security and what potential vulnerabilities could it open up?
